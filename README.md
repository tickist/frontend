## What is Tickist

Tickist is not only a place, where you may gather your daily tasks. It was also designed as a tool for the continuous improvement of effectiveness and efficiency of time management. The functionalities offered by Tickist ― such as nested lists, tags, flexible due dates (on that date and by a date) and estimated time ― should help us all to manage our time more effectively. A to-do list doesn’t have to cause negative associations. We want to enjoy the ticking and our well-deserved free time
